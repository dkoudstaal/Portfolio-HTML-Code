# Why a Digital Portfolio
 You are an IT student and you want to apply for a job in the IT industry. How are you going to present your IT skills?

I have been a programmer and IT teacher for some time and in my experience most of my IT students do not have a digital portfolio.

Have you ever wondered if it is good enough to claim in a letter you have IT skills in say programming or networking? Why not support your claims with a digital portfolio?
