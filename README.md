# About Portfolio HTML Structure


The HTML code is a simple structure for the creation of an electronic portfolio.

I have created this simple HTML portfolio structure for high-school and college students. This portfolio structure is mainly for students seeking IT type employment. 
You can use this mark-up to present your work on Python, the Raspberry Pi and any other academic achievements.

This code enables you to present a flash-drive with your portfolio to any potential employer or educational institution. The code is designed as a stand-alone and not for a server.

I have used [Alex Gorbatchev's SyntaxHighlighter](http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/) in this portfolio framwork to represent your Python code.
