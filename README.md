 The HTML code is a simple structure for the creation of an electronic portfolio.

I have created this simple HTML Portfolio Structure for high-school and college students. The HTML mark-up allows you to create a digital portfolio which you can use with a job application or with an educational institution's entry application.

Once you created your portfolio, you can present the digital portfolio on a flash-drive to any interested person or organisation. I have also used JavaScript and CSS3 as part of the design and behaviour of this portfolio. The code is tested with the latest Firefox, Chrome and Explorer browsers

I have incorporated [Alex Gorbatchev's SyntaxHighlighter](http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/) in this portfolio structure for the easy presentation of programming code.
