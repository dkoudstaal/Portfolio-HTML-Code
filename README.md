### Portfolio
The html code is a simple structure for the creation of an electronic portfolio.
You can use this mark-up to present your work on Python, the the Raspberry Pi and any other academic achievements.

This code enables you to present a flash-drive with your portfolio to any potential employer or educational institution. The code is designed as a stand-alone and not for a server.

I have used [Alex Gorbatchev's SyntaxHighlighter](http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/) in this portfolio framwork to represent your Python code.
